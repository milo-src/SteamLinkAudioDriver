# SteamLinkAudioDrivers

These are the Steam Link audio drivers designed for Windows 8.1 and 10 PCs. They are hosted here due to the absence of an official Valve download source.

For those unfamiliar, Steam Link enables real-time streaming of your Steam Library across different platforms. The audio drivers are typically installed during the initial stream setup and subsequent streams. An often-overlooked aspect of these drivers is that the Steam Streaming Microphone and Steam Streaming Speakers can seamlessly replace any existing Virtual Audio Cable setup, and the best part? It's absolutely FREE! This functionality forms the backbone of my Soundboard.

Installation is straightforward: simply right-click the .inf files and select "Install".

If Valve happens upon this and expresses concern about the unauthorized publication of their product, it's completely understandable. Developing such tools likely involved considerable effort, and I have no intention of diminishing the hard work of the team behind them. I'm more than willing to remove this upload upon requestâ€”provided that Valve offers a prominent, publicly accessible download link for these files on the Steam Link support site. It's crucial to make these drivers easily accessible, considering they're provided free of charge.

All credit for the creation of these drivers goes to Valve Software.
